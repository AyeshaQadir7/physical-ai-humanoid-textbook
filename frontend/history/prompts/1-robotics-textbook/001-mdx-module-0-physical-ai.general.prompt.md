## Prompt

Generate MDX chapter for 'Module 0: What is Physical AI?' with the following learning outcomes:
1) Understand embodied intelligence and how AI operates in physical systems
2) Understand the bridge between digital AI systems and physical robot control
3) Learn real-world applications of Physical AI in robotics

Chapter details:
- Title: "What is Physical AI?"
- Module: 0.1
- Sidebar Position: 1
- Introduction: Explain why Physical AI matters - AI isn't just in the cloud, it controls robots that interact with the physical world.
- Core Concepts:
  * Embodied Intelligence: Definition and examples
  * Digital AI vs. Physical AI: How they differ
  * Sensors and Actuators: The bridge between perception and action
  * Real-world Applications: Manufacturing, healthcare, research
- Include practical examples of humanoid robots
- Add practical considerations section
- Include a summary that bridges to the next chapter
- Format as professional educational MDX with proper frontmatter, headings, and structure

## Response snapshot

Created a comprehensive, production-ready MDX chapter (654 lines) with:

**Structure:**
- YAML frontmatter with SEO metadata (title, description, keywords)
- Engaging introduction contextualizing Physical AI
- Clear learning outcomes section (5 measurable outcomes)
- Six main content sections: Embodied Intelligence, Digital vs Physical AI, Sensors/Actuators, Real-World Applications, Practical Considerations, Humanoid Robots
- Embedded 5-question quiz with detailed answer explanations
- Transition to next chapter with estimated reading/comprehension times

**Content Quality:**
- 2100+ words of substantive educational content
- Clear progressive complexity (conceptual → practical → implementation)
- Real hardware examples with specification tables (RealSense D435i, Unitree G1)
- ASCII diagram showing sensor-actuator feedback loop
- Comparison table: Digital AI vs Physical AI (6 key dimensions)
- 6 real-world application domains with impact metrics
- Practical constraints section addressing sim-to-real gap, power management, safety
- Notable humanoid robots section with specifications

**Assessment:**
- 5 quiz questions directly mapped to learning outcomes
- Multiple choice format with detailed answer explanations
- Questions include: conceptual understanding, practical troubleshooting, implementation challenges
- Challenge question (Sim-to-Real Gap) for advanced learners
- Answer keys with "Why others are wrong" educational feedback

**MDX Compliance:**
- Valid YAML frontmatter
- Proper heading hierarchy (H1 title, H2 sections, H3 subsections)
- Markdown formatting: bold, italic, lists, blockquotes, code blocks
- HTML5 <details> tags for collapsible quiz answers
- Proper table formatting with pipes and alignment

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete educational chapter ready for curriculum integration; all learning outcomes addressed; quiz provides formative assessment
- 🧪 Tests: MDX syntax validated; frontmatter structure correct; internal link references checked; 654 lines verified; all content sections present
- 📁 Files: `/docs/module-0-foundations/01-what-is-physical-ai.mdx` created with full content (654 lines)
- 🔁 Next prompts: Create Module 0.2 (Humanoid Platforms), integrate into sidebars.ts if needed (autogenerated), validate build process
- 🧠 Reflection: Chapter successfully bridges learner knowledge gap between "What is AI?" and "How do robots work?" Uses multiple pedagogical techniques (comparison tables, ASCII diagrams, real examples, scaffolded quiz questions) to maintain engagement and clarity

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None; MDX syntax validated, all placeholders filled, content structure complete
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS - File created, 654 lines verified, frontmatter valid, no broken references
- Prompt variant (if applicable): null
- Next experiment: Validate in Docusaurus build process to confirm sidebars autogeneration picks up new module structure
