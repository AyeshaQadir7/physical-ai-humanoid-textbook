# Core Concepts & Fundamentals

## Welcome to Physical AI

Before we dive into code, simulation, and voice-controlled robots, let's build a shared understanding of **Physical AI**—what it is, why it matters, and how your 13-week journey will transform you from a curious student into someone who can command robots with natural language.

This module sets the stage. You'll explore:
- What **embodied intelligence** means in the context of robotics
- Why **humanoid robots** are becoming central to research and industry
- The available **hardware platforms** and learning paths
- How this course will take you from theory to a capstone project

**Time commitment**: 2 weeks (Weeks 1–2)
**Hands-on content**: Minimal code; focus on concepts and context
**Capstone connection**: Everything here informs your robot design and deployment strategy

---

## Module Learning Outcomes

By the end of Module 0, you will be able to:

1. **Define embodied intelligence** and explain how it differs from traditional AI (ChatGPT, computer vision)
2. **Identify real-world applications** of Physical AI in manufacturing, healthcare, exploration, and research
3. **Understand the humanoid robotics landscape**—platforms like Unitree G1, Boston Dynamics Atlas, and Open Robotics' platforms
4. **Choose your learning path**: simulation-only, simulation + edge hardware, or full physical deployment
5. **Assess prerequisite knowledge** (Python, robotics fundamentals, linear algebra basics)
6. **Map your 13-week journey** and understand how each module contributes to your capstone project

## Chapter Breakdown

### Chapter 0.1: What is Physical AI?
**Focus**: Foundations and definitions

- Define **embodied intelligence**: AI systems that perceive and act in the physical world
- Understand the **AI perception→decision→action loop** in robotics
- Explore real-world examples: Tesla robots in factories, Boston Dynamics robots in warehouses, research robots in hospitals
- Contrast with **digital-only AI**: ChatGPT works with text; your robot must sense the world

**Reading time**: ~30 minutes
**Key takeaway**: Physical AI is about *connecting digital intelligence to physical embodiment*

---

### Chapter 0.2: Why Physical AI Matters
**Focus**: Industry relevance and research significance

- The **humanoid robotics boom**: Why humanoids? Why now?
- Industry trends: Tesla Bot, Boston Dynamics, Unitree, and the race for autonomous systems
- **Simulation vs. physical**: Why we use both (sim-to-real transfer learning)
- **Why you should care**: Job market demand, research opportunities, real-world impact

**Reading time**: ~30 minutes
**Key takeaway**: Physical AI is not academic—it's transforming manufacturing, healthcare, and research *today*

---

### Chapter 0.3: Humanoid Robotics Landscape
**Focus**: Available platforms and design trade-offs

- **Commercial platforms**: Unitree G1, Tesla Optimus, Boston Dynamics Atlas
- **Research platforms**: Open Robotics' designs, academic robots
- **Simulation platforms**: Gazebo, Isaac Sim, Unity
- **Cost vs. capability**: What hardware fits different learning goals?
- **Your path**: Simulator-only, Jetson Orin Nano + sensors, or physical robot access?

**Reading time**: ~40 minutes
**Key takeaway**: You can learn humanoid robotics *without expensive hardware* using simulation

---

### Chapter 0.4: Learning Path & Prerequisites
**Focus**: Self-assessment and roadmap

- **Self-assessment quiz**: Do you have the background needed?
- **Prerequisite knowledge**: Python fundamentals, basic linear algebra, optional robotics exposure
- **Three learning paths**:
  - 🖥️ **Simulation-Only** (Ubuntu + ROS 2 + Gazebo + Isaac)
  - 🛠️ **Edge Hardware** (Jetson Orin Nano + RealSense + ReSpeaker)
  - 🤖 **Full Physical** (Unitree G1 or equivalent)
- **Time commitment**: 5–7 hours/week for 13 weeks
- **What to expect**: Coding, simulation, labs, capstone project

**Reading time**: ~30 minutes
**Interactive**: Self-assessment quiz
**Key takeaway**: Choose your path and commit to the time investment

---

### Module 0 Summary: Foundations Ready
**Focus**: Recap and transition

- Recap the four core chapters
- Glossary links for key terms you've encountered
- **Bridge to Module 1**: "You now understand *what* Physical AI is. Next week, we learn *how* to build it using ROS 2."

**Reading time**: ~15 minutes

---

## How This Module Connects to Your Capstone

Every chapter in this course builds toward your **Week 13 capstone**: a voice-controlled humanoid robot that responds to natural language commands.

### Module 0 Contributions to Capstone:
- **Conceptual foundation**: Why you're building this robot (embodied AI)
- **Hardware choice**: Will you use simulation, edge hardware, or physical robots? (Chapters 0.3–0.4)
- **Motivation**: Understanding the real-world impact of your work
- **Prerequisite check**: Making sure you're ready for Weeks 3–13

Module 0 is your **launch pad**. By the end of Week 2, you'll be ready to dive into **ROS 2** (Module 1), where the real coding begins.

## Prerequisites & Self-Assessment

### What You Should Know Coming In:
- **Python 3.8+**: Basic syntax, functions, classes, libraries
- **Linux basics**: Terminal navigation, package managers, environment variables (optional but helpful)
- **Math**: Linear algebra (vectors, matrices) nice-to-have; calculus optional

### What You'll Learn:
- **ROS 2** (Middleware for robot communication)
- **Gazebo/Isaac** (Simulation environments)
- **SLAM/Navigation** (Robot perception and movement)
- **Vision-Language-Action** (Connecting LLMs to robots)

### Ready?
Take the self-assessment quiz in Chapter 0.4 to confirm you're prepared. If you lack Python basics, spend a day reviewing [Python for robotics fundamentals](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/) before starting.
