# Getting Started & Setup

## Welcome to Your Robotics Journey

Before diving into the hands-on modules, you need to ensure you have the foundational knowledge, choose the right learning path for your goals, and properly configure your development environment.

This module is your **launchpad** – it helps you:
- Evaluate your current knowledge and skills
- Understand what you need to know before starting
- Choose the learning path that matches your goals and resources
- Configure your development environment correctly
- Know where to turn when you get stuck

Over the next 13 weeks, you'll invest 8-10 hours per week building hands-on robotics skills. Success requires honest self-assessment and proper preparation.
